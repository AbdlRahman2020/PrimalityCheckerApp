# Verisign Internship 2021

Hello applicant!

Nice to see you here, step right in. Before we proceed with your application for an internship with Verisign in Switzerland, you will need to prove your technical skills by implementing a very basic application (details below). This exercise should not take you longer than about two or three hours - maybe even a lot less.

Follow the following steps and turn in your solution on or before April 28th, noon UTC. Good luck!

## Steps to follow / app requirements

1. Fork this repo.
2. Make your fork of this repo private and add me (@snhrdt) as a collaborator.
3. Implement a web application meeting the following requirements:
    * The app consists of a backend and a frontend.
    * The backend is implemented in Spring Boot 2.4 .
    * The frontend is implemented using React and Tailwind or Bootstrap.
    * When a user navigates to the root of the application, the app displays are form styled with CSS with a labeled input field.
    * The label shall say "Enter a number: "
    * The input field should only accept positive integer numbers.
    * The Submit button of the form should read "Check for primality".
    * On submission of the form, the frontend should call an endpoint on the backend and submit the entered number.
    * The backend then checks whether the submitted number is prime or not, and it returns the result to the frontend.
    * The frontend displays the result in an appropriate manner; could be an alert window or (preferably) a CSS-styled div .
1. Write documentation on your application as a markdown page in your fork of this repository:
    * How can it be run from a developer machine?
1. Show by example how you would test both the backend and the frontend of your application; if you would like to add some test code to demo it, please do so; if you want to write some text about testing your app, please do so as a markdown page in your fork of this repository.
2. Ping me on LinkedIn, letting me know that you completed this task. Please include a link to your fork of this repository so I can have a look.

Again, thanks for your application and good luck!
